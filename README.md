# Notes on take-home assignment
 - This repository contains instructions for a take-home assignment used when
   evaluating candidates for Software Development positions at BrainMill.
 - Any work done by a candidate on this task is owned by the candidate.
 - The task is specifically not commercially usable for BrainMill, i.e. a
   candidate is not performing "free work" for BrainMill.
 - Please cap your time investment to a maximum of 2 focused hours. Exceeding
   this will negatively affect the evaluation.
 - BrainMill expects a candidate to perform the task independently, but use of
   any aids are allowed (just as if you were actually working for us).
 - Should you for some reason not want to perform the task, please let us know
   at jobs@brainmill.com and explain why and we will see if it possible to come
   up with an alternative evaluation which fits you better.
 - Once the task is completed, please compress the cloned folder and email it
   to jobs@brainmill.com.
